# vue-runescape-calculator

This is a very basic skill calculator for [OldSchool Runescape](https://oldschool.runescape.com/). I created this project to get a grasp on starting Vue and believe it can also be a useful tool to others who are beginner programs and need code to reference.


## Project setup

Inside the directory you cloned or downloaded the zip:
```
1. npm install
2. npm run serve
```

### Todo List:

* Add rest of skill content
* Various CSS styling
* Examples of how router works
* Player lookup from hiscores
  * This exists under the branch **feat/hiscore** in a very primitive state, but I am omitting it from master as of now due to the complexity of setting up CORS headers on a localhost for a beginner.
* Comments and other various notable markings to show how things work in Vue
